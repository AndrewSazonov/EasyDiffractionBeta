This is a test version of EasyDiffraction with improved GUI and overall performance. This version temporarily does not use the EasyScience framework, contains only CrysPy as calculation engine and uses only Lmfit for minimization.  

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed loading of CIF files generated by FullProf.
- Fixed formatting of parameters in CIF files and analysis table.
- Fixed symmetry constraints of the unit cell angles.
